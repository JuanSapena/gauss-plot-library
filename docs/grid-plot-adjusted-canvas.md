# GAUSS scatter plot grid with adjusted canvas size

## Description
This file will generate a grid of scatter plots using an adjusted plot canvas size. This file demonstrates:
1.  Using the GAUSS `plotCanvasSize` procedure
2.  Using the GAUSS `plotLayout` to plot a grid of graphs on one canvas

## Example

## Source Code
Find the code for generating this graph [here](https://github.com/ec78/gauss-plot-library/blob/master/src/grid-plot-adjusted-canvas.gss)

## Data
The accompanying data is found in the file [ScatterData.xlsx](https://github.com/ec78/gauss-plot-library/blob/master/data/ScatterData.xlsx). It should be placed in the same directory as the program file.
