# GAUSS horizontal odds ratio with confidence intervals

## Description
This file will generate an 'east-west' plot of odds ratios with confidence intervals. Regression labels are plotted on
the y-axis. A number of plot customization options are demonstrated including:
1. Adding custom lines to a plot using `plotAddShape`.
2. Customizing an added feature to a graph using the `plotAnnotation` structure.
3. Adding text boxes to a graph using `plotAddTextbox`.
4. Using a `plotControl` structure to customize graph features including
  *  Setting X and Y ranges of a graph using `plotSetXRange` and `plotSetYRange`.
  *  Setting the number of tics on an X and Y axis using `plotSetXTicCount` and `plotSetYTicCount`.
